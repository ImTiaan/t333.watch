# t333.watch Comprehensive Project Plan

## Executive Summary

This project plan outlines the implementation of t333.watch, a multi-stream viewer platform for Twitch that allows users to watch multiple streams simultaneously, save collections as "Packs," and discover trending content. The plan is structured into incremental phases, each broken down into testable components with clear acceptance criteria, risk assessments, and resource allocations.

The implementation follows a progressive approach, starting with core infrastructure and gradually adding features while maintaining a budget constraint of $200/month for infrastructure. Each phase builds upon the previous one, with comprehensive testing at every stage to ensure quality and stability.

## Conclusion

This phased development approach allows for incremental delivery of value while managing technical complexity and budget constraints. By focusing on core functionality first and progressively adding more advanced features, t333.watch can establish a solid foundation and grow based on user feedback and business performance.

Each phase builds upon the previous one, with clear acceptance criteria and comprehensive testing to ensure quality and stability. The plan is designed to be flexible, allowing for adjustments based on user feedback, technical challenges, and business priorities.

The project stays within the $200/month budget constraint, with a projected cost of approximately $150/month at full implementation. Regular reviews at the end of each phase will ensure the project stays aligned with its goals and constraints.
