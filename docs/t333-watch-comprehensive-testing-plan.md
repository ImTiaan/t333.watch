# t333.watch Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the t333.watch project, a multi-stream viewer platform for Twitch that allows users to watch multiple streams simultaneously, save collections as "Packs," and discover trending content. The testing plan is aligned with the phased development approach outlined in the project plan and addresses all user stories and acceptance criteria to ensure a high-quality product.

The testing strategy employs a multi-layered approach combining unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and security testing. It establishes clear processes for test creation, execution, and defect management while defining phase-specific test plans with entry and exit criteria. The plan also integrates testing into the CI/CD pipeline to support continuous delivery while maintaining quality within the project's $200/month infrastructure budget constraint.

## 1. Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall Approach to Testing

The t333.watch testing strategy follows these key principles:

1. **Shift-Left Testing**: Testing begins early in the development lifecycle to identify issues before they become costly to fix.

2. **Risk-Based Testing**: Testing efforts are prioritized based on risk assessment, focusing on critical functionality and high-risk areas.

3. **Continuous Testing**: Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to provide rapid feedback on code changes.

4. **Multi-Level Testing**: Different types of tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) are employed to ensure comprehensive coverage.

5. **User-Centric Testing**: Test cases are derived from user stories and acceptance criteria to ensure the product meets user needs.

6. **Automated and Manual Testing Balance**: Automation for regression and repetitive tests, with manual testing for exploratory and user experience validation.

7. **Performance-Focused**: Special attention to performance testing due to the resource-intensive nature of multiple video streams.
