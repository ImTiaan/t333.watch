# Implementation Plan: Performance Optimization and Mobile Responsiveness

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for improving Performance Optimization and Mobile Responsiveness in the t333.watch application.

## 1. Performance Optimization

### 1.1 Overview

We will implement a comprehensive performance monitoring system that captures both client-side and server-side metrics, and provides appropriate warnings to users when performance issues are detected. The system will not automatically adjust quality settings but will provide clear warnings to users.

### 1.2 Technical Approach

#### Client-Side Metrics
- Use the Performance API and custom metrics to track client-side performance
- Implement a metrics collection system that doesn't impact performance itself
- Output detailed metrics to browser console in a structured, readable format
- Focus on key metrics: FPS, memory usage, stream loading time, and UI responsiveness
- Include periodic summary logs with aggregated performance data

#### Server-Side Metrics
- Implement middleware to track API response times
- Monitor database query performance
- Track resource usage (CPU, memory) on the server
- Output server metrics to console logs in development
- Include request-specific performance data in API responses (in development mode)

#### Warning System
- Create non-intrusive warning UI components
- Implement threshold-based warnings for different metrics
- Provide actionable suggestions when warnings appear
- Ensure warnings don't disrupt the user experience
